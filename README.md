This a custom-made missile script for the game Space Engineers. <br />
It works coupled with a missile of my own design, which in short is a cluster bomb which based on examples from real life. <br />
The missile is currently WIP, as of now it can currently only hit targets at the provided GPS coordinates. Currently there also implementations of mechanism such as: <br />
- Proportional navigation
- Bomb trajectory simulation and prediction
- PID controlled bomb trajectory correction
Currently I'm work on implementing a LIDAR radar for automatic target detection and tracking for the missile's guidance system.
You can check out two short posts on this missile that I've made on reddit: <br />
